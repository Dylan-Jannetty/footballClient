#Planning and Development
Before I started coding I wanted a good layout and plan. Therefore, I made wireframes and user stories. My user stories consisted of authentication listing all things users should be able to do with upon signing up or signing in. I then moved on to user stories consisting of what the user will be able to do once signed in. I then followed these steps to making the client side of my application:
Build sign up on Client
Build sign in on Client
Build change PW on Client
Build sign out on Client
Build create Team on Client
Build update Team on Client
Build delete Team on Client
Build get all Teams on Client
Styling of the page

#Unsolved Problems
In the future I want to add a csv file that has all 32 teams listed and a description of each team. So instead of typing in your team it'll have a scroll down menu to pick each team. Then when you click get teams it will show your teams and have an option to see a description of the team.
